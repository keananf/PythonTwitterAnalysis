# PythonTwitterAnalysis
Python program to analyse twitter datasets

##Running the virtual environment
##(requires [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html), [install instructions](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html))
With conda installed, in the directory of the project files:
this makes the virtual environment with the name 'twitter-analysis'
```
make env
```

or, if you want to make the environment with a different name:
```
make env NAME=the-name-you-want
```

Next, to enter the virtual environment, type `source activate <environment-name>`, the name will be 'twitter-analysis' by default; and to exit type `source deactivate`.
